# Three.js basic-setup 🐈
![Garbield](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukedev820/Three.js-basic-setup/master/Banner.png)
## Info 🐈
This is just a basic and silly setup/template for [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). I mainly made this as a reference and a possible foundation for any silly projects I make with Three.js. 

[Live demo:](https://lukedev820.github.io/Three.js-basic-setup/)
## Setup 🐈
Once you have cloned the repo all you need to do is run `index.html` via a local server. This can be done in a variety of ways but i recommend using [Visual Studio's "Live Server" extension.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
## Configuration 🐈
All the code is mainly in `js/script.js` 
The CSS and HTML are very minimal and you'll rarely work on it unless your adding a text overlay.
## Contributions 🐈
I must admit I am still quite new to both Three.js and JavaScript. If you think i could have done something better or you believe a feature could improve the demo [(Dat GUI for example)](https://sbcode.net/threejs/dat-gui/) feel free to make a pull request!
